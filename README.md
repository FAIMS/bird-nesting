# About this module:
This module was created for the **Griffith Ecology Lab**, a research group based at Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia. The module has been designed for longitudinal monitoring of bird nesting in the rural New South Wales, Australia. The project is monitoring the process of bird nesting, egg laying and hatching of wild Zebra Finches and other bird species in NSW, Australia.

## Authorship
This module was co-developed by Simon C. Griffith and Hanja Brandl at Macquarie University and Adela Sobotkova and Petra Janouchova at the FAIMS Project, Department of Ancient History, Macquarie University.

## Funding:
Development of this module was funded by MQ Strategic Infrastructure Scheme 20110089 for FAIMS development in 2016 and the **Research Attraction and Acceleration Program (RAAP)** aimed to support innovation and investment in the New South Wales in 2016 and 2017.


## Date of release:
July 2016, simplified version released in August 2017

## FAIMS Mobile version
FAIMS **v2.5** (Android 6+)

## Access:
This module is part of the **FAIMS Demo library** on our publicly accessible Demo server (http://demo.fedarch.org/). 

## This module contains the following FAIMS features:
* internal logic governed by custom temporal queries (if action X happens, module sets site revisit alert to Y days, e.g. if an egg hatches, revisit needed in 7 days to measure the chick)
* coordinates from internal GPS
* validated fields with user observations
* attribute-level timestamps
* photo capture from device camera
* controlled vocabularies


## This module can be used with no or minor modification for:
* monitoring of bird boxes, with a hierarchy of nests, eggs, and chicks and their dimensions
* longitudinal study (multiple site revisits over time, recording changes over time)
